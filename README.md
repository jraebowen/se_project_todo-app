# Simple Todo App

This is a simple to-do app that was built by the TripleTen team and refactored by me to leverage classes and modules.

## Functionality

This app allows users to add new items, set due dates for items, mark items as completed, or delete the item entirely.

## Technology

Pre-built by TripleTen team: HMTL, CSS
Refactored by me:

- JavaScript - refactored files to follow OOP principles which includes creating classes as well as breaking it out into modules

## Deployment
